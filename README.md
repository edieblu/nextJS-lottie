# Hello Lottie folks ðŸ‘‹

Inside this repository, you'll find a Lottie search page lookalike ðŸ˜Š.

## Summary

I've implemented some of the features you've suggested and added a couple of my own ðŸ˜Š. Obviously, I ran out of time, and since I wanted to give you a rough idea of what I can do in one afternoon, I've decided to stop here.

Due to time constraints, I wrote this using the technology I know best: ReactJS and Sass. However, NextJS was new to me.

## ðŸŒˆ Features
- Search by location
- Filter by price
- Filter by review
- Infinite scrolling
- Lots of components ðŸ˜…
- I've styled everything from scratch
- (And added your font! )

## Things I would've done if I had more time
- location pin and a map (since we already have both longitude and latitude in the json)
- state management with `useContext`
- individual listing pages
- more filter option
- âœ¨ loading skeleton + spinners + animations
- etc, etc, etc ðŸ˜†


## ðŸ¤” How to run?
Once you've cloned the repo, install the dependencies, then run `yarn dev`

## ðŸš€ Deployment
The app is deployed [here](https://lottie-amber.vercel.app/)
